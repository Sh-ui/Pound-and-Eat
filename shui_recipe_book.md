# Shui's Recipe Book

A collection of molcajete-powered recipes that embrace the art of pounding, smashing, and hand-torn preparation. These recipes are designed for weeknight cooking, minimizing cutting board use while maximizing flavor and texture through the use of a molcajete (mortar and pestle). Each recipe follows a simple workflow: ingredient → pound → pot/pan → eat.

## Core Principles
- Minimal cutting board use
- Embrace irregular textures from pounding
- Hand-torn ingredients where possible
- Single pot/pan cooking
- Bold, global flavors
- Flexible serving styles (bowls, leaves, wraps)
